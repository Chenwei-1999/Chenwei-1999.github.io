Chenewi Xu is a master's student in Computer Science at Northwestern University with a strong research background and a keen interest in developing machine learning tools for real-world applications. His current research focus revolves around Tabular Learning, where he has achieved a significant milestone by creating a State-Of-The-Art model, soon to be detailed in a forthcoming paper. In addition to his academic pursuits, Chenewi is actively involved in research at Fermilab, applying Reinforcement Learning to optimize the Mu2e simulator's spill regulation. Beyond research, he enjoys cooking and maintains a strong commitment to fitness.
