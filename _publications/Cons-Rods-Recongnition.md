Adaptive optics imaging has enabled the enhanced in vivo retinal visualization of individual cone and rod photoreceptors. Effective analysis of such high-resolution, feature rich images requires automated, robust algorithms. This paper describes RC-UPerNet, a novel deep learning algorithm, for identifying both types of photoreceptors, and was evaluated on images from central and peripheral retina extending out to 30Â° from the fovea in the nasal and temporal directions. Precision, recall and Dice scores were 0.928, 0.917 and 0.922 respectively for cones, and 0.876, 0.867 and 0.870 for rods. Scores agree well with human graders and are better than previously reported AI-based approaches.
